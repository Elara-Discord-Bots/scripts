With this script you can download any file you want without the hassle of waiting for the high traffic alert to go away or get premium for GoFile (**If you can afford it please support gofile though**)

-------

# Tampermonkey: (Automatic)
- Create a new script via the Tampermonkey extension
- Copy the code from [scripts/gofile/tampermonkey.js](https://github.com/Elara-Discord-Bots/scripts/blob/main/gofile/tampermonkey.js) and add it to the newly created script on the extension page.
- Now when you go to a folder on gofile it shouldn't ever show you the high traffic alert message again.

------

# Console Script: (Manual)
- Go to the GoFile site (i.e: `https://gofile.io/d/:folder_id`) then
- Copy the code from [scripts/gofile/console.js](https://github.com/Elara-Discord-Bots/scripts/blob/main/gofile/console.js) and paste it into your console
- You should be able to download any file on the page without the high traffic alert message showing up
